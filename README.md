# 18F Micro-purchase platform auction submission repo
This is a repo where you can suggest auctions to run on the micro-purchase platform. You may want to first review our documentation so you can learn how to [get started](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/docs/getting_started) and get more details about how to [create an auction](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/docs/getting_started)

Right now, the micropurchase platform is optimized for code auctions, but we are interested in expanding this, so don't be afraid to suggest other types of work, like research or design. As we explain in our documentation, we aim to keep the asks small (doable within a one week sprint), so keep that in mind as you're putting together your submission.

To submit a suggested auction:

1. [File a new issue](https://github.com/18F/micropurchase-auctions/issues/new) in this repo

2. Fill out all the information in the suggested issue template

3. Add a label `new auction`

4. If you are still waiting on an IAA, add the label `iaa needed`

5. Then contact @adelevie or @mtorres in the #micropurchase-bizdev channel to let us know about it.

# What can I expect?
Someone on our team will take a look and get back to you within a couple of business days. We may want to work with you a little more to sharpen the requirements of the auction, or we may just run it!
