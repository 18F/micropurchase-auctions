# 18F Micro-purchase - Submit an auction
The [Micro-purchase platform](https://micropurchase.18f.gov) has demonstrated a [good deal of success in the past year delivering quality open source code at a good price for a variety of agency customers and projects](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/insights). We want to make it easier for our customers to submit potential auctions, so we've created this repo to help.

Two important things to know before you get started. 

1. Based on our learnings over the last year, Micro-purchase auctions work best when you are auctioning off a user story that has been groomed, prioritized and estimated by your team. If you don't already have one, we can help you with that. 
2. You will need an active IAA with enough money left in the budget to pay the winning vendor the maximum amount of the award.


## How to submit an auction:

1. [File a new issue](https://github.com/18F/micropurchase-auctions/issues/new) in this repo.

2. Give your issue a title

2. Fill out all the information requested in the issue template

3. Add a label `new auction`

4. When you're ready, click the "Submit new issue" button (rather than "Create an epic").

5. Contact [@adelevie](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/@adelevie/) or [@mtorres](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/@mtorres/) in the [#micropurchase-bizdev](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/micropurchase-bizdev/) channel to let us know about it, or to ask any questions.

## What happens after my issue is created?
Someone on our team will take a look and get back to you within a couple of business days. We may want to work with you a little more to sharpen the requirements of the auction, or we may just run it! In either case, we'll keep you in the loop. 

Once your auction is published, you'll be able to see it on [Micro-purchase platform](https://micropurchase.18f.gov). We will make sure the auction is advertised in advance, and we will manage the auction all the way through to delivery.

When the winning vendor delivers the work we will let you know, and we will work with someone on your team to evaluate the work. If the code is accepted, someone from your team will merge it into the code base and deploy it to production.

## Some important reminders:

Before creating an auction, you may want to first review our documentation so you can learn [what makes a good auction](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/docs/getting_started) and how you go about [creating one](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/docs/getting_started).

Right now, the platform is optimized for code auctions, but we are interested in expanding this, so please suggest other types of work, like research or design. As we explain in our documentation, we aim to keep the asks small (doable within a one week sprint), so keep that in mind as you're putting together your submission.

_It's also worth emphasizing that auctions and open source contributions in general are not a replacement for a product team, including developers who are familiar with the code base. The platform will get you the code, but you and your team are responsible for defining the requirements, evaluating the delivered work, merging any pull requests, and deploying accepted code to production._
