# 18F Micro-purchase - Submit your auction
The [Micro-purchase platform](https://micropurchase.18f.gov) has demonstrated a [good deal of success in the past year delivering quality open source code at a good price for a variety of government open source projects](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/insights). If you're unfamiliar with the micro-purchase auction platform, read about it [here](https://18f.gsa.gov/search/?q=micropurchase). 

If you have work that you (TTS product leads, product owners, or product team members) want to do, and not enough staff to take it on, running an auction may be a good solution. We've helped teams do things like add [new functionality to their slackbot](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/admin/auctions/25), [set up Docker compose for their app](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/admin/auctions/22) and [even create a set of Wagtail templates](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/admin/auctions/32). And, it's taken as little as 2 weeks from the time an auction is advertised for quality code to be delivered to your team by one of the vendors in our open source community.

Submitting auctions in this repo will give us the information we need to start working on your request.

Two important things to know before you get started. 

1. Micro-purchase auctions work best when you are auctioning off a user story that has been groomed, prioritized and estimated by your team. If you need help with this, drop a note in the [#micropurchase-bizdev](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/micropurchase-bizdev/) channel.
2. You will need an active IAA with enough money left in the budget to pay the winning vendor the maximum amount of the award.


## How to submit an auction:

1. [File a new issue using our template](https://github.com/18F/micropurchase-auctions/issues/new)

2. Give your issue a title

2. Fill out all the requested information

3. Add a label `new auction`

4. When you're ready, click the "Submit new issue" button


## What happens next?
Someone on our team will take a look at the issue you've created, and get back to you within a couple of business days. We may want to work with you a little more to sharpen the requirements of the auction, or we may just run it! In either case, we'll keep you in the loop. 

Once your auction is published, you'll be able to see it on [Micro-purchase platform](https://micropurchase.18f.gov). We will make sure the auction is advertised to the micro-purchase vendor community (600 strong) in advance, and we will manage the auction all the way through to delivery.

When the winning vendor delivers the work we will let you know, and we will work with someone on your team to evaluate the work. If the code is accepted, someone from your team will merge it into the code base and deploy it to production. The Micro-purchase team can pay the vendors using our p-card and reconcile the cost with the existing IAA.

## Some reminders:

Before creating an auction, you may want to first review our documentation so you can learn [what makes a good auction](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/docs/getting_started) and how you go about [creating one](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/docs/creating_an_auction).

Right now, the platform is optimized for code auctions, but we are interested in expanding this, so please suggest other types of work, like research or design. As we explain in our documentation, we aim to keep the asks small (doable within a one week sprint), so keep that in mind as you're putting together your submission.

_It's also worth emphasizing that auctions and open source contributions in general are not a replacement for a product team, including developers who are familiar with the code base. The platform will get you the code, but you and your team are responsible for defining the requirements, evaluating the delivered work, merging any pull requests, and deploying accepted code to production._
