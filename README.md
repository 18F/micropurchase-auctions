# 18F Micro-purchase - Submit an auction
This is a repo where you can suggest auctions to run on the [micro-purchase platform](https://micropurchase.18f.gov). You may want to first review our documentation so you can learn how to [get started](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/docs/getting_started) with an open source project and get more details about how to [create an auction](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/docs/getting_started)

Right now, the micropurchase platform is optimized for code auctions, but we are interested in expanding this, so don't be afraid to suggest other types of work, like research or design. As we explain in our documentation, we aim to keep the asks small (doable within a one week sprint), so keep that in mind as you're putting together your submission.

_It's also worth emphasizing that auctions are not a replacement for a product team including developers who are familiar with the codebase. The platform will get you the code, but you and your team are responsible for evaluating the code and merging accepted code in a timely manner, and deploying any delivered code to production._


## How to do it:

1. [File a new issue](https://github.com/18F/micropurchase-auctions/issues/new) in this repo.

2. Give your issue a title

2. Fill out all the information requested in the issue template

3. Add a label `new auction`

4. If you are still waiting on an IAA, add the label `iaa needed`

5. When you're ready, click the "Submit new issue" button (rather than "Create an epic").

6. Then contact [@adelevie](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/@adelevie/) or [@mtorres](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/@mtorres/) in the [#micropurchase-bizdev](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/micropurchase-bizdev/) channel to let us know about it.


## What happens next?
Someone on our team will take a look and get back to you within a couple of business days. We may want to work with you a little more to sharpen the requirements of the auction, or we may just run it! The auction includes delivery of code. Someone on your team must be responsible for evaluating that code, merging accepted code and making sure the code gets deployed.

Once your auction is published, you'll be able to see it on [micro-purchase platform](https://micropurchase.18f.gov). We will make sure the auction is advertised in advance, and we will manage the auction all the way through to the delivery.
