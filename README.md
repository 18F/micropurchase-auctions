# Submit an auction!
A repo where anyone can add suggested micro-purchase auctions. Please review our documentation so you can learn how to [get started](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/docs/getting_started) and details on how to [create an auction](https://micropurchase.18f.gov/docs/getting_started)

# How do I do that?

- File an issue in this repo containing information about your auction

- Fill out all the information in the suggested issue template

- Add a label `new auction`

- If you are still waiting on an IAA, add the label `iaa needed`

- Then contact @adelevie or @mtorres in the #micropurchase-bizdev channel to let us know about it.

# What can I expect?
Someone on our team will take a look and get back to you within 2 business days. We may want to work with you a little more to sharpen the requirements of the auction, or we may just run it!
